# ☕ Brafé Project (Bootstrap Version)

A responsive website developed during the **Advanced CSS – Positioning Course** by [Origamid](https://www.origamid.com/).  
This version of the **Brafé** project was rebuilt using the **Bootstrap framework**, focusing on leveraging its grid system, components, and utility classes to create modern, efficient layouts.

## 🚀 About the Course

The course covered the fundamentals of **Bootstrap**, teaching how to structure pages using its **12-column grid system**, apply responsive design principles, and use built-in components to speed up front-end development.

The goal of this project was to transform the original **Brafé website** (built with pure CSS) into a **Bootstrap-based version**, understanding how to use pre-built styles and utilities effectively while maintaining clean and organized code.
